# FIVBDrillsApp
An app to simplify running sand vb practice.

This app was built originally in Netbeans. I then ported it and continued development on Intellij.

I have future plans to port it for use in Eclipse.

This application uses Tomcat 8.5, Java 1.8, Spring 5.0.6, Maven 2.

The stack is as follows:
HTML, JQuery, CSS; Java 1.8; MySQL 8
